üìò Metagenomic Insights into the Abundance and Mobility of Antibiotic Resistance Genes and Associated Mobile Genetic Elements in Wheat Rhizosphere Samples Using a Bioinformatics Pipeline
üîç Project Overview
This repository contains the complete bioinformatics pipeline and associated Linux scripts used in my master's dissertation project. The study focuses on identifying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in metagenomic samples from the wheat rhizosphere, assessing their abundance and potential mobility using a comprehensive metagenomics-based computational workflow.

üß™ Objectives
Identify and annotate ARGs from shotgun metagenomic sequences.

Detect and classify MGEs such as plasmids, integrative elements (ICEs/IMEs).

Investigate ARG mobility by checking for oriT, relaxase, T4CP, and T4SS elements.

Perform binning and MAG quality assessment.

Perform taxonomic classification and calculate relative abundance of MAGs.

üß≠ Workflow Steps
Each script in this repository corresponds to a stage in the bioinformatics workflow, organized below in execution order:
